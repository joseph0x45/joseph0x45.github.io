  <h1><strong>Getting started with programming the Raspberry Pi Pico W with C/C++</strong></h1>
  <h2>Note: All links found on this page open in a new tab :)</h2>
  <p>Hello dear reader, in this article I will show you how you can install the Raspberry Pi C/C++ SDK on Arch Linux so
    you can get started programming the board</p>
  <p>I will link some useful resources at the end of the article so stick around.</p>
  <p>First make sure you have the required dependencies installed on your system. Run `sudo pacman -S make cmake git` to
    install them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next we need to install the libraries that will be used to build and compile our C/C++ code into a format that can
    be executed by our Raspberry Pi. Very conveniently, there is an AUR package named <strong>pico-sdk</strong> that you
    can install using an AUR helper like <strong>yay</strong>. To install it using yay just run <strong>yay -S
      pico-sdk</strong>. You can
    also manually
    build it, by cloning the git repo, and running <strong>makepkg -si</strong> from the root of the directory. But if
    you are a beginner/want
    to save time, just use an AUR helper.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once that is done, the next step is to clone the sdk from Github. As of the time I am writing this blog post, the
    sdk resides at <a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk">https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk</a>. Use <strong>git clone
      https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk</strong> to get it on your system and put it in a folder somewhere. When
    it's cloned, go into the folder and run
    <strong>git submodule update --init</strong> This will clone some libraries needed for the Pico W.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we can try building an example project and uploading it on our board. We will start with the blink program. You
    can find the example code and many
    more examples at <a
      href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples">https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples</a>.
    Keep in mind that if you are using the Pico W you need to look inside the <strong>pico_w</strong> folder for the
    appropriate examples. That mistake cost me a lot of time. So, locate the blink example project which is in <a
      target="_blank" href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/blink">blink</a> if you are using a
    regular Pico,
    or in <a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/pico_w/wifi/blink">pico_w/wifi/blink</a> if you are
    using a Pico W. You can also clone the examples repository for easier access.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inside the example folder you will see different things based on the one you chose according to your board. Since
    this article is for the Pico W we will go with that. In our folder we need two things, a
    <strong>CMakeLists.txt</strong> file and then a C file containing our code. There are two example for the Pico W,
    picow_blink.c and picow_blink_slow_clock.c. Just pick one. Next we need to update the content of our CMakeLists.txt
    file. Head over to <a target="_blank" href="./CMakeLists.txt">this link</a>, copy and replace the content of your
    CMakeLists.txt file with it. You can later on update it as you please. And to finish, copy the
    <strong>pico_sdk_import.cmake</strong> from the sdk you cloned. The path should be
    <strong>/path/to/sdk/pico_sdk_import.cmake</strong>. Copy it in place it in your example project folder.
  </p>

      line in that file is doing</summary>

  </details>
  <p>
    At this point your C file should contain the code corresponding to your platform and your CMake file should also
    contain the correct configuration for CMake
    to generate the build files for your project. Now create a directory named <strong>build</strong> in your example
    project folder. If you have done everything well we should have this folder structure in your example project:
  <ul>
    <li>A C file containing our code</li>
    <li>A CMakeLists.txt file containing configuration for CMake</li>
    <li>The pico_sdk_import.cmake file copied from the cloned sdk repo</li>
    <li>An empty build directory</li>
  </ul>
  Double check that and if everything is correct we move on to the exciting part.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, we need to tell CMake where to find our sdk, so run <strong>export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/sdk</strong>. That
    done, from the build directory, run the following command <strong>cmake ..</strong> Which essentially means to
    generate the build files for the configuration that is in the folder above. It will generate a bunch of files. Next
    run <strong>make</strong> to compile the project. When it's done, you should have another bunch of files generated
    and among them should be a <strong>.uf2</strong> file, that is the one file we need to copy to our board.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plug your USB cable into your computer. Next, locate the BOOTSEL button on your Pico, press and hold it and plug the
    USB in while still holding the BOOTSEL. Wait one second and release the BOOTSEL. This will essentially make your
    Pico act as a mass storage device. On some Linux systems, the Pico should automatically appear in your file system,
    but if it doesn't then it means you have to mount it yourself. You can find a lot of tutorials online on how to do
    this. Once your Pico is showing as a mass storage device, just copy the .uf2 file to it and if everything went well,
    the Pico should not appear anymore as a mass storage device. It should reboot and the LED should start blinking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Congratulations, you just made the first steps in becoming an embedded software programmer. Now, everything doesn't
    always go well, while I am confident that this article covers all the problems I had while doing this myself, you
    might still encounter some bugs depending on your local environment. If that happens, don't let it discourage you, I
    was in the same spot, use Google, ask people on Reddit, Discord, everywhere you can get help. And you will solve the
    issue.
  </p>
  <p>I hope this have been useful, until next time.</p>
